URI, URL, URN: 
    used to identify resources on the internet. (نستخدمهم عشان نوصل لمكان/ ريسورس معين على الإنترنت)


[URL (Uniform Resource Locator)]:
    -used to identify resources using it's location.
    -example: http://example.com/resource.

[URN (Uniform Resource Name)]:
    -used to identify resources using it's name (location-independent resource identifier).
    -doesn't provide the means to access the resource directly; 
        instead, it names the resource in a globally unique and persistent way.
    -example: urn:isbn:0451450523.


[URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)]:
    -used to identify resources using it's name, or it's location.
    -is a generic term for all types of names and addresses that refer to objects on the web.
    -any URL is a URI.
    -any URN is a URI.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
typically we don't use URN, because it is not pre

URL consists of these parts: 
    1-protocol used to access the resource (such as HTTP, FTP), 
    
    2-domain name (such as youtube.com),  
        -to identify the location of the server you want to access.
        -you can use ip address for the server instead of it's name.
    
    3-(optional) port number: 
        -telling a server from which port our request is comming and from which should be received,  
            (e.g. www.example.com:8080).
        -each protocol has it's default port number,
            if we don't specify it, it will be the default and it doesn't appear in the URL.
            (HTTP typically uses port 80, while HTTPS uses port 443).
    
    4-(optional) specific path to a specific resource in the server: (e.g. video id or the login page),
        if you don't write it, it will convert you to the default directory (e.g. index.php).

    5-(optional) Query: provides additional parameters or arguments for the resource, often used in web requests,
        (e.g. ?key1=value1&key2=value2).
    
    6-(optional) Fragmants: Refers to a specific section within the resource (e.g. #advanced-level)
