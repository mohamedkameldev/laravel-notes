when defining a relation, you can specify different actions to be taken when a referenced record is deleted or updated. 
Here are some of the available options:

[On Delete]: 
    -cascadeOnDelete(): 
        when a record in the referenced table is deleted, all related records in the current table will also be deleted automatically.

    -setNullOnDelete(): 
        set the foreign key column in the current table to null when a record in the referenced table is deleted.
        It effectively removes the association but doesn't delete the related records.

    -restrictOnDelete(): (the default one)
        prevent deletion of a record in the referenced table if there are related records in the current table. 

    -noActionOnDelete(): 
        This option is similar to 'restrictOnDelete()'. 
        prevents deletion of a record in the referenced table if there are related records in the current table without any cascading or setting to null.

    -setDefaultOnDelete(): 
        This option will set the foreign key column in the current table to its default value when a record in the referenced table is deleted. 
        You can specify the default value when defining the column.


[On Update]: 
    -cascadeOnUpdate(): 
        cause a cascade update, that's mean: 
        when the primary key of the referenced record is updated, the foreign key values in the current table will also be updated.

    -setNullOnUpdate(): 
        set the foreign key column in the current table to null when the primary key of the referenced record is updated.

    -noActionOnUpdate(): 
        prevents updating of the foreign key values in the current table when the primary key of the referenced record is updated.

    -setDefaultOnUpdate(): 
        set the foreign key column in the current table to its default value when the primary key of the referenced record is updated.
