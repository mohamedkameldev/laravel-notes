Service Container (or Inversion of Control (IOC)): 

    -is the place where (all services) in your app are been registered.
    -apply Dependancy Injection Pattern to resolve dependancies between different classes/services.
    
    -[is a powerful tool for managing class dependencies and performing dependency injection].

    -In Laravel application, [the app instance is the container].

    -You can bind any custom services you want in container.

    -It has basically three methods 
        bind(): used for binding services,
        make(), used for retrieving services,
        singleton() , used for binding class as a singleton.
    

    -app(): this global helper returns an instance of the container.
        $container = app();
