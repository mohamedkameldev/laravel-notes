Dependancies: 
    are the components which depend on each other.
    e.g. Comments class depend on User class 
        (which means to create any comment you need to create a user with it)

    There is a big problem in Dependancies: 
    if you want to change the constructor of the User class, you must edit all of it's dependancies.



Dependancy Injection: 
    is a design pattern used in software development to manage dependencies between objects.
    allows the class to receive its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them itself.
    This approach promotes loose coupling and enhances the modularity, testability, and maintainability of the code.
