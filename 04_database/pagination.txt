You can use paginagion using: (query builder) or (ORM).

when u paginate a query, it returns with multiple variables u can use: 
    -perPage: 10
    -currentPage: 1
    -path: "http://localhost:8000/category/1"
    -query: []
    -fragment: null
    -pageName: "page"
    -onEachSide: 3
    -total: 13
    -lastPage: 2

don't forget {{$products->links()}} to show the numbered list at the end ot the page.


Important Note: 
    HTML code that's generated by the paginator is compatible with Tailwind CSS framework;
    however, Bootstrap pagination support is also available, you can do the following: 
        [App/provider/Appserviceprovider/write'Paginator::useBootstrapFour();'in the boot method].
        [App/provider/Appserviceprovider/write'Paginator::useBootstrapFive();'in the boot method].
