(char('code', 10))
    fixed-length character column type.
    always uses the specified length for storage, padding shorter strings with spaces.
    suitable when you need fixed-length strings.
    more efficient for searching and sorting compared to VARCHAR because all values have the same length. 
    however, it may waste storage space if most of your values are shorter than the defined length.

(string('name'))
(string('name', 10))
    Equivalent to VARCHAR. 
    commonly used when you don't need to specify a specific length for your string columns. 
    a good choice for general text columns when you don't have strict length requirements.
    by default VARCHAR(255) but you can change it's value,

(lineString('name', 10))

(multiLinestring('name', 10))
